## Draft User Stories


1. As a customer on this site, I want to be able to log in/register and save information so that it will be easier to find in the future. 
2. As a gamer with experience, I want to be able to readily post my knowledge so that I can share what I feel has helped, and provide advice on how it may benefit newcomers. 
3. As a gamer at any skill level, I want to be able to filter out which games the hub covers so that I can find the guides easily. 
4. As a gamer at any skill level, I want to be kept up to date on any new games announced so that I can pre-order and play the game as soon as possible. 
5. As a newcomer to a complicated game, I want to have easily digestible and accessible information regarding the mechanics of the game I’m playing, so that I’m able to become better at accomplishing the competitive tasks.
6. As a game developer, I would want to be able to teach others how to develop a game, but would need it to be done in a way someone unfamiliar with programming can digest. I want this feature so that more people can be inspired to create new games. 
7. As a quality assurance engineer / bug tester, I would want to volunteer my efforts and write about any bugs I encounter in my playthrough through a video game I enjoyed so that the developers can fix it and make the game even better.
8. As a developer, I would want to look at the responses / feedback from users to understand what my team should be focusing on for our next stages of development.
9. As a marketing manager, I want to advertise and showcase our game on a user-friendly platform so that we get increased visibility.
10. As a forum user, I want to be able to ask questions without having to rely on another user to answer the question since it might have already been answered previously in a different context.

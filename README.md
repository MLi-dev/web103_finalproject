## About

### Description and Purpose

[text goes here]

### Inspiration

Saad and I are both avid video game players and have been significantly helped in our gaming sessions in the past thanks to youtubers (WeezyTF2, Game makerâ€™s toolkit, Gamedev) or chat forums such as Steam that would provide walkthroughs or tips. There are many levels no doubt in any game with lots of challenges and have an optimal way to complete.  From personal experience, most of the guides are scattered across multiple sites and especially on youtube, there is more challenge on being able to keep track of which timestamps for very important gaming tips. So, our goal is to create a centralized forum for any games to be discussed and even allow users to make their own contributions to help others. 

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React

Backend: Node

## Features

### Ability to filter games the user is interested in.

This will involve basically sorting through and dynamically assigning a game as a topic to wherever a post gets made and allow users to filter for a specific game

### Account information for people who are signed in. 

This'll allow for users to setup profiles and have their own preferences which might be used as a pub-sub system for people to get updates related to the games they like in a recommendation system

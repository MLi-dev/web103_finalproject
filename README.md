## About

### Description and Purpose

[text goes here]

### Inspiration

Saad and I are both avid video game players, and we've faced lots of challenges in boss fights/levels. Our idea is to create a comprehensive guide of tips and tricks to overcome each level, as well as teach any game mechanics players can take full advantage of. Personally, I (Matthew Li) was inspired by a Team Fortress 2 Youtuber named WeezyTF2 who plays lots of this gamemode called "Mann versus Machine" and he often provides advice for new players.

## About

### Description and Purpose
Description: Generalized forum for guides for different video games. Allowing people to be able to communicate with a chatgpt-like chatbot with the context of the posts on a game
Purpose: With game discussions generally being haphazard, finding an answer to your question about specific attributes can be time-consuming. By making a centralized space, weâ€™ll make it easier for users to find any information they need.


### Inspiration

Saad and I are both avid video game players and have been significantly helped in our gaming sessions in the past thanks to youtubers (WeezyTF2, Game makerâ€™s toolkit, Gamedev) or chat forums such as Steam that would provide walkthroughs or tips. There are many levels no doubt in any game with lots of challenges and have an optimal way to complete.  From personal experience, most of the guides are scattered across multiple sites and especially on youtube, there is more challenge on being able to keep track of which timestamps for very important gaming tips. So, our goal is to create a centralized forum for any games to be discussed and even allow users to make their own contributions to help others.

## Custom Features 

### Ability to filter games the user is interested in. (The web app allows filtering and/or sorting as appropriate for your use case)

This will involve basically sorting through and dynamically assigning a game as a topic to wherever a post gets made and allow users to filter for a specific game

### Account information for people who are signed in. (Data is automatically generated in response to a certain event or user action. Examples include generating a default inventory for a new user starting a game or creating a starter set of tasks for a user creating a new task app account.)

This'll allow for users to setup profiles and have their own preferences which might be used as a pub-sub system for people to get updates related to the games they like in a recommendation system

## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
We felt that for this unit, what went well was that we were being proactive and reaching out to each other in the beginning. This head start on the project led to us pretty quickly converging on a topic we’d like to work on. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
We flip-flopped many times between different ideas before finally coming up with the final vision. 
Saad and I initially weren’t sure if we wanted to make the site around a select number of games, or make it all possible games. So we decided that it should allow users to contribute. 	

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
Integration of custom features that are not being covered in the course and setting up the technologies to do so. In addition, we will need to decide who will cover what base for the project. .

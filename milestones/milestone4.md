## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We had a pretty strong understanding of the basics alongside a good idea of what our tasks were for this week so we were able to get a lot done.  

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

There weren't any major challenges for the week

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We finished all of our tasks for the week

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I think the main feature that might be at risk is the AI chatbot which we'll start to develop in greater detail next week.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We'll probably continue needing more feedback in terms of how the project is designed to make sure the user experience works well since we're the developers that can make it so the challenges users face might not be immediately apparent to us because knowledge of how the project works is implicit to us.
